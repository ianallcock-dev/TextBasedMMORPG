# YOUR_PROJECT_NAME

A modern take on an old genre, a homage to the old turn based text MMORPGs I used to play. I wanted to re-live the experience so decided to build one.

This project features:

- âœ… Text based MMORPG based on the old style Mafia/gangster games
- âœ… Steampunk theme
- âœ… Automated turn based mechanics with 7 day rounds
- âœ… In-built game mechanics such as
      - Recruit Thugs
      - Setup Operations
      - Recruit Entertainers
      - Collect cash and items
      - Attack and rob other players
      - Create/join gangs
- âœ… Flexible design for desktop and mobile
